1. Why CSS selectors are used in HTML?
Ans : CSS selectors are utilized in HTML to effectively target and style specific elements on a webpage. They allow developers to apply styles selectively to elements based on their IDs, classes, attributes, or element types, enabling precise customization of appearance and layout without altering the HTML structure.

2. What are the different types of Selectors in CSS?
Ans : There are various types of CSS selectors:
a. Element Selectors: Target specific HTML elements (e.g., p for paragraphs).
b. Class Selectors: Identify elements with a specific class (e.g., .classname).
c. ID Selectors: Style elements with a particular ID (e.g., #uniqueID).
d. Attribute Selectors: Select elements based on their attributes (e.g., [type="text"]).
e. Descendant Selectors: Target elements nested within other elements (e.g., parentElement childElement).
f. Pseudo-selectors: Style elements based on their state or position (e.g., :hover, :nth-child()).

3. How do you include external fonts and apply them?

@font-face {
  font-family: 'CustomFont';
  src: url('path/to/font.ttf') format('truetype');
}
body {
  font-family: 'CustomFont', sans-serif; 
}
