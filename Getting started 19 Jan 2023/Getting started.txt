To write comments, use <!-- at the beginning and --> at the end, encapsulating the commented text. This ensures browsers ignore these comments while displaying the content.

Attributes, on the other hand, are additional properties applied to elements enclosed within tags, defining behavior or appearance.

4. Briefly explain what HTML  entities are.

These entities aid in rendering specific characters correctly on web pages without disrupting the HTML structure or causing parsing errors.
